## My process

Pretty simple; HTMl w/BEM naming convention, and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practiced some more of BEM naming convention, see below:

```html
<main class="card__body">
  <h2 class="card__title">Etherium</h2>
  <p>Lorem ipsum sit dolor amit bruh.</p>
</main>
```

```css
.card__body {
  color: papayawhip;
}

.card__title {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```
